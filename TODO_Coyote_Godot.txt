	Player object
		Needs script with info
		Needs the AI script
	Main game
		Will need visible:
			Space for player objects
			UI for bidding, menus
			Game log (scrollbar)
	UI for player to take a turn
	
Immediate goals:
	Make the main menu button prompt for if you really want to return to main menu?
		Might not be necessary now that you have to click two buttons to get to it
	Implement the thing where all cards are shown after a challenge
		Also, maybe make it so it somehow pauses before starting the next turn
		after a challenge?

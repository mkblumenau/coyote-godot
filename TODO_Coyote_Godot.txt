Goals:
	Make the game log a little easier to read?
		Idea: make the game log only visible through a menu
		Instead, have a display for the most recent action
	Make the main menu button prompt for if you really want to return to main menu?
		Might not be necessary now that you have to click two buttons to get to it
	Improve the AI
	Fix a bug: If you Shift-Tab from Open Menu when the user UI isn't showing,
	you just completely lose the ability to focus
